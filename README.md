The App is built using BLoC pattern, useful to separate UI from logic components of the app, making it easier to mantain.

In order to use the App, the first thing you have to do is create a new wallet, or import an existing wallet. After that, you will be able to choose between Mainnet and Ropsten (is recommended to first use this testnet to try the features provided before actually using real SEED tokens).

Current features:
    
    - View all the baskets and the corresponding startup list
    - Contribute to baskets by sending SEED token
    - Follow the progress of all the baskets you are interested in or you've invested on
    - Keep up to date with all edits the Incubators will make to their Baskets or including Startups with our notifications System, grabbing informations directly from the Blockchain
